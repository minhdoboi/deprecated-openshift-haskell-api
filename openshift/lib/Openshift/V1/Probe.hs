    , httpGet :: Maybe HTTPGetAction -- ^ HTTPGet specifies the http request to perform. 
    , tcpSocket :: Maybe TCPSocketAction -- ^ TCPSocket specifies an action involving a TCP port. TCP hooks not yet supported 
    , initialDelaySeconds :: Maybe Integer -- ^ Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are initiated. More info: http://releases.k8s.io/HEAD/docs/user-guide/pod-states.md#container-probes
